# Multi-Threaded Matrix Multiplication

Multiplication of matrices is a core operation in neural network and especially deep learning. So, this repository contains an implementation of the naive and multi-threaded matrix multiplication in Java and C++ and also comparing then with the GEMM algorithm.
